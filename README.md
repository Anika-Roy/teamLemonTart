## Problem Statement
Create a command-line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the weather forecast. Leverage Open Weather Map API to get the weather forecast.

# Judging critrions satisfied
## Functionality and Completeness
> This section lists the features and highlights the points adhering to the judging criteria of `Functionality and Completeness`.

- CLI has an autocomplete feature to get the city name.
- CLI has an interactive interface to select the date of forecast.
- CLI has an interactive interface to select the time of forecast.
- A pretty-printed output is shown in the terminal.

## Github Copilot utilization
> This section is an explanation of how we used Github copilot to speedup our process of writing code.

- Almost all of our functions were autcompleted by Github Copilot.
- To do this, we declared functions and added docstrings below them. This allowed Copilot to be able to autogenerate the rest of the code.
- A lot of pretty printing and util functions were mostly written by Github Copilot. This saves a lot of time and grunt work that would otherwise be expensive.

## Code Quality and Readability
- Almost all of these functions have a docstring with them
- Almost every line of code has a comment preceding it, this also allowed Copilot to quickly autocomplete most lines of code (rarely requiring our intervention).
- We have followed proper variable naming conventions for Python.

## UI and UX
- We have used interactive features in the CLI to make it look pretty and increase ease of use.
- Easy to read output for the forecast is provided with a fun looking symbol for the weather.

## Error Handling and Validation
- Most functions return a json object containing the error message
- The main function is protected by a try-except clause that will catch the error and display the error message.

## Innovation and Creativity
- We have tried keeping the user in mind while making the forecase tool.
